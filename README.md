# Colabradoodle: A Semantic Agent Collaboration 🐾

**Welcome to the Colabradoodle repository!**  
This project is the digital artifact of a one-day experimental workshop where a group of curious developers, designers, researchers, and educators came together to explore the chaos and magic of distributed multi-agent systems.

## 🧠 What is Colabradoodle?

Colabradoodle is a playful, collaborative network of local agents communicating via semantic routing. Powered by **publish-subscribe (pub/sub)** principles, the system allows agents to:

- Discover and interact with each other dynamically.
- Respond to semantically meaningful queries.
- Perform tasks like data retrieval, sensor reading, research assistance, and more.
- Share experiences and collaborate in real-time!

At its heart, Colabradoodle celebrates experimentation, creativity, and the occasional overload-induced meltdown.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Semantic Routing:** Agents communicate and find each other based on the semantic meaning of messages, not fixed paths.
- **Dynamic Discovery:** The network grows and adapts as agents join, leave, or evolve their capabilities.
- **Automated Programming:** Many components were created using AI-assisted code generation, accelerating the pace of development.
- **Ephemeral by Design:** Colabradoodle existed for just one day. The system is frozen in this repo, a snapshot of pure experimentation.

## 📂 Repository Contents

- `agents/`: The code for the agents that formed the Colabradoodle network. Each agent has its own personality, tasks, and quirks.
- `router.py`: The semantic routing and discovery service that kept the network alive.
- `logs/`: A selection of logs capturing the interactions, chaos, and emergent behavior of the network during the day.
- `docs/`: Reflections, notes, and takeaways from the workshop participants.

## 📖 How to Use

While the network is no longer live, you can:

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourorg/colabradoodle.git
   cd colabradoodle
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Upgrade pip and install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

4. Explore the agent code and the semantic routing implementation.
5. Run your own mini-version of the network by starting the agents and router locally.
6. Laugh at our mistakes and learn from them. 😊

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Workshop Reflections

At the end of the day, we gathered to reflect on what we learned. Here are some highlights:

- **Emergent Chaos:** Overload was not just a possibility—it was a feature. The system thrived (and crashed) in unexpected ways, teaching us about the limits of decentralized collaboration.
- **Semantic Power:** Routing by meaning instead of fixed paths opened new possibilities for adaptive behavior.
- **Human Connection:** Sharing the same space while building this system created its own kind of magic.
